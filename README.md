# Measure Work Breaks



The application will let You know how long Your breaks are.
Each time You go for a break, You press the "start break" button, and when you return - the "go back to work" button. Automatically, the length of each break will be saved in the daily report:bowtie:
Of course the stopwatch can be used not only for work breaks.
